## Project Summary

Our project, MentorAI, is an AI chatbot designed to act as a tutor for Computer Science students at UIUC. This AI tutor creates a customized learning experience by assessing each student’s level of understanding of certain topics based on their academic history, such as past exam scores. It evaluates their current understanding of the material and adjusts the difficulty and topics of practice problems to make learning more efficient. As students demonstrate improvement and consistency in grasping certain concepts, the tutor will begin making questions harder, or dial back the difficulty otherwise. 

The AI tutor will use a large database of academic content, which will include practice problems, exams, as well as explanations of problems and concepts in order to adjust to students’ varying levels of understanding. It also provides a comprehensive learning experience by switching between topics and focusing on concepts that students have struggled the most with. The primary goal of MentorAI is to offer a personalized learning experience that caters to each student’s strengths and weaknesses, which is something that is otherwise often difficult to achieve in large classroom settings. With its chat-style interface, MentorAI encourages students to ask questions and interact with the tutor, making the learning process more engaging.
